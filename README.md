# SyriaTel Churn

## Business Understanding

SyriaTel is a national telecommunications company interested in reducing churn by identifying which clients will ‘soon’ stop doing business with their company. By reducing churn, SyriaTel will save money because it costs less to maintain business than it does to gain new business. 

## Method

This objective will be achieved by first assessing feature importance on the below attributes and determining which tend to be the strongest predictors of churn.

I will then apply these attributes to several classification machine learning models to classify at risk clients presently and in the future. 

The final step will ultimately be the launch of a final program on existing clients.

#### Treating Type Errors
In the Telecom industry it costs 5 times as much to attain new business then it does to maintain existing business. In dealing with type errors moving forward, type 2 errors pose the highest threat to SyriaTel’s company. Ideally, we will find a balance between the two type errors, but if that is not attainable, we are better off reducing type 2 errors despite the fact that it will lead to a subsequent increase in type 1 errors. In this case, a false positive (assuming a client will churn when they will not) is preferrable to a false negative (assuming that a client will not churn when they actually will).
